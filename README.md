# AI-Augmented DevSecOps Framework

An AI-enhanced security automation framework for cloud-native applications, featuring real-time threat detection and automated response capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time threat detection using LSTM neural networks
- Automated security policy enforcement
- Integration with Kubernetes and cloud platforms
- Prometheus metrics and monitoring
- CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins integration

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster
- Jenkins
- Prometheus

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-devsecops-framework.git
cd ai-devsecops-framework
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure settings in `config/settings.yaml`

## 🏗 Architecture

### High-Level System Architecture
